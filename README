This project includes a demo Google Map using API V3 and MarkerClusterer.

It also includes two JSON files that detail the mildly scrubbed content from the USDA site here:

Original Data Source:  http://search.ams.usda.gov/farmersmarkets/

Inspiration for this repo/effort came from John Mertens' API work here: 
    http://codeforamerica.org/2011/08/08/farmers-market-api/

All of the content for what is available at each location is present in the JSON, but there is no 
filtration present on the page (yet - I may come back to this).  Also, there are quite a few 
addresses that didn't geocode on the first couple of passes, the technique was to 
  1) Search on the full address content from USDA
  2) Search on the city, state, zip content from USDA
  3) Search on the county, state, zip content from USDA
  4) Give up.

A lot of data points have strange psuedo locations in their street address field.  Many of 
these ended up geolocated by city, and hence there are a lot of markers that sit atop one 
another.  This makes it difficult to click on the various markers that are all (in theory) near that 
location.
